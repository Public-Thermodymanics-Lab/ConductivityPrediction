# ConductivityPrediction
Predicting conductivity of various salt solutions

First set the parameters in "conductivity.py", then run the program.
assym_conduct and Simple_conduct are backend code, don't edit them.
assym_conduct  is for asymmetrical electrolytes, and was developed following the paper
Simple_conduct is for symmetrial electrolyes, it's not really used cause assym_conduct covers everything
